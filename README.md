Aidanish is my own conlang made just for fun.
All entries are spanish-based, that means all of them are a translation to a spanish word, so you will see `hola -> hai` instead of `hello -> hai`

Running `all.py` will put all entries from all text files on lexicon/types into lexicon/all.txt
Running `words.py` will put all the aidanish words from all text files on lexicon/types into words.py without repeating
Running `main.py` is a shortcut to run all the rest of python files.
