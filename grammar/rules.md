### How to form verbs
Verbs can be form in multiple ways.
`(subject) (auxiliar) (verb) (object)` or
`(subject) (verb)(suffix) (object)`

Both correct but preferably the latter.
Examples:

Na sei Antikore -> I am Antikore
Ei ingoi torkopa -> He eats potato
Zu bei eir hundo -> You give him a dog

The auxiliar/suffix tells the time of the verb

`Na sei` -> I am
`Na seio` / `Na nei sei` -> I was
`Na seie` / `Na nex sei` -> I will be
`Na seiki` / `Na nopi sei` -> I would be

# Imperative verbs
If you want to order something, do it like this
`Doiet xo` -> Do it!

Add -et at the end to make it obligatory

# Gerund and participle
Add -ieon to the verb to form a gerund
Add -ioto to the verb to form a participle

# Auto-verbs
These are verbs that are executeed to itself, and they are formed by changing the subject by the object, and removing the object from the end
`Na loi ner` -> `Ner loi` / I love myself

### How to form plurals
Plural forms of most words are made by adding -it at the end of the word, if the words ends in a vowel, you can optionally remove it.
`Koixa` -> `Koixait` / `Koixit`
`Joglar` -> `Joglarit`

# How to understand genders
Words can have two genders, male or female
When the male gender is the predominant in the compound of words, it refers as "Ei"
When the female gender is te predominant in the compound of words, it refers as "La"

The predominant can be defined like any of these, depending on the word order
`(Noun gender) (Noun) (Adjective)`
`(Noun gender) (Adjective) (Noun)`
`(Adjective gender) (Adjective) (Noun)`

Genders are set by multiple set of rules, you can check genders at "genders.txt" file
